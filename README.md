# IRIS-Recognition-and-Identification-CASIA
This project explores IRIS recognition using the CASIA dataset, applying techniques like CNN for classification, Gabor+NN for texture analysis, and SIFT+BFMatcher for feature matching. It preprocesses images, extracts features, and evaluates performance for accurate biometric identification.
